README: Orchestrator
Overview
The Orchestrator is a tool designed to automate and streamline security analyses. It integrates with testssl and semgrep to provide comprehensive vulnerability assessments and code analysis. The results are then parsed and stored in a MySQL database.

Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose installed
Ensure that the ports 5000 and 3307 are free on your machine.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aliraf62/orchestrator_ali orchestrator
cd orchestrator
Build and Run the Docker Containers:

css
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Usage:
To trigger an analysis, use the following curl command:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "url=[target-url]" -F "customer_id=[id]" http://localhost:5000/analyze
Replace [target-url] with the URL you want to analyze and [id] with a customer identifier.

View Logs:
To see the logs for a particular service, use the following command:

css
Copy code
docker-compose logs [service-name]
For example, to view the logs for the app, you can use:

Copy code
docker-compose logs app
How It Works
Upon receiving a request, the Orchestrator will:

Run testssl against the provided URL if a URL is given.
If a file is provided, semgrep will be run for code analysis.
The results from these tools are then parsed using custom parsers and stored in the MySQL database.
Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the Orchestrator project, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter a "port already in use" error, ensure that the ports 5000 and 3307 are not being used by other services.
If the testssl container seems to hang or take a long time, check its logs using docker logs [container-id] to see if it's processing or if there's an error.

Special thanks to the testssl and semgrep projects for providing the tools integrated into this project.
